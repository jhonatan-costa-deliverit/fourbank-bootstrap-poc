# Fourbank - SPI

## About the project
> The system is responsible for managing financial transactions, which serve as the source 
> of funds used in operations such as Pix transfers. Whenever a customer initiates a transaction, 
> the amount is debited from this account. To ensure continuous operation, the system issues 
> notifications when the balance reaches a critical level, indicating the need for a 
> transfer from the current account.

## About ChartJs
>Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, 
> and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart 
> types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types . On top of that, 
> itâ€™s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart 
> (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas).

## About ng2-charts
>ng2-charts is an Angular wrapper for Chart.js, a popular JavaScript charting library. 
> It allows developers to easily integrate responsive and customizable charts 
> (such as line, bar, pie, radar, and more) into Angular applications using simple 
> components and directives.

## About bootstrap
>For standardization, best practices and responsiveness, when developing new pages,
> think about the structure of rows and columns following the grid pattern.

**Example:**

| Grid pattern class | Description                                                                    |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.container`       | Container with spacing on the sides (width: 1200px).                           |
| `.container-fluid` | Container without spacing on the sides(width: 100%).                           |
| `.row`             | Single div, must be used as a parent div that will have 1 to 12 col child divs |
| `.col`             | Single div, must be used as a parent div that will have 1 to 12 child divs     | 

>***The pattern shown above in the table shows the structure of the project's html pages, new pages must follow the pattern.***
